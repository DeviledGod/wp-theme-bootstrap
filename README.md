## Development Guidelines

- Avoid committing the built theme to the project repository
- Avoid committing the `wp-uploads` directory to the project repository
- Avoid making changes directly to the built theme -- Always use the build process
- In production avoid uploading the theme development directory to a public server
- It is good practice to enable `WP_DEBUG` in your `wp-config.php` file, *but only* during development

## Standard Theme Development Process

### Setup

1. Install WordPress and clear it of unnecessary default themes & plugins
1. Clone/Download this repository into a directory in your WordPress `wp-content/themes` directory
1. Open the terminal and `cd wp-content/themes/<devthemename>`
1. Run `npm install` to install all dev dependencies
1. Change the `package.json` with your new theme's configuration
1. Run `gulp` to begin the dev build process that uses libsass, browser-sync and webpack
1. Log in to the admin and enable the **built theme**
	 (**Note:** The *dev theme* is not a valid theme, that's fine! Don't delete it or try to enable it)

### Development

1. Run `gulp` to begin the dev build process that uses libsass, browser-sync and webpack
1. Develop your theme in the `/assets` and `/theme` directories, the built theme will be generated by gulp
1. For your convenience during development:
	- use `npm install --save <module(s)>` to easily manage dependencies, then use `var <module> = require('<module>');` anywhere you want to use them
	- explore the `/library` directory in the dev theme for anything useful to your project. If you find anything
	  copy it into your `/theme` folder somewhere under `/theme/includes`, modify it as you require and include it where you need it <== Not implemented yet

### Production

1. Delete files you are not using from inside the `/theme` directory
1. [Add a screenshot.png](http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Screenshot)
1. Before deploying run `gulp build` to generate a production ready version of the built theme
1. Deploy the built theme directory, *not the dev directory*
